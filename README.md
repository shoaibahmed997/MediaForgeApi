# MediaForge Api

## Purpose.

this repo contains the api for mediaforge, which is a media management system and a port of cobalt in python fastapi.
the purpose of this project is mainly for learning and fun. the plan is to self host it on my homelab server and give access to my family to manage our media collection.

## Cobalt

the original project is [cobalt](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt). use that by all means. this is just a fun project for me to learn and practice my python and backend skills. i have no plans to make this a full fledged media management system, but if you want to contribute or use it for your own project feel free to do so.
